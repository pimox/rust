This patch exists because of https://bugs.debian.org/977627

block-buffer's "block-padding" feature was removed in debian -- it's
no longer optional -- due to the constraints around empty features
negotiated with the FTP team.

However, no additional Provides: was added, and attempts to explicitly
add an empty named feature to block-buffer with "Provides" end up
failing with:

Something failed: failed to parse manifest at `â€¦/debcargo-conf/build/block-buffer/Cargo.toml`

Caused by: Features and dependencies cannot have the same name: `block-padding`

So instead, as a workaround, we just make an explicit dependency also
on block-padding here in sha3.
